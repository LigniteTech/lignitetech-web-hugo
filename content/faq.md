## 1. WHAT IS MINER?

LigniteTech Miner is Cloud SaaS is the SaaS (Software as a Service) implementation of a data relationship analysis platform. It aims to provide a mechanism to link and visualize unstructurally related data. There is out of the box support for a variety of publicly available datasources and a flexible data model allows for the easy integration of any proprietary datasource.

## 2. WHAT TYPES OF DATA CAN BE ANALYSED?

Any data that can be captured digitally is a candidate for being used.

For instance you can see that two people have a connection

![Person to Person](/img/screenshots/person-to-person.png)

In this case you can see that a person has a connection to a building

![Person to Building](/img/screenshots/person-to-building.png)

Within the data model not only are the entities treated as first class citizens but so is the type of connection between them.

## 3. WHAT DATA SOURCES CAN BE USED?

Any addressable source that has a text based data or meta data component can be used as a source. Publicly available streaming sources such as Twitter, Google Plus or Facebook can be used to provide real time data. In addition, static snapshots of data can be provided using Relational databases, NoSQL databases and Flat files. Finally data can also be extracted from Big Data endpoints such as Apache Sparl, Apache Kafka or Apache Flink.

## 4. HOW MUCH DATA CAN BE ANALYSED?

The underlying technology used can be used to efficiently store and retrieve billions of data points. Several hundred thousand events per hour can be consumed, analysed and linked.

## 5. CAN PROPRIETARY DATA SOURCES BE USED?

Given the modular way in which the data is stored, the platform is agnostic about the source of the data. If you require data from a non public source then our consulting team will be available to manage the entire delivery from determining requirements, development, installation and support of the bespoke components.

## 6. HOW IS THE SYSTEM ACCESSED

Typically platform is hosted in UK / US / EU data centres, which customers connect using an encrypted web connection. This will require configuration of any customer firewalls which are in place (led by the customer in conjunction with our support team). Platform instances will not be shared between customers or any other third party.

A typical service for 5 users will run on a 10Mb/s web connection. We are able to advise on bandwidth requirements for larger deployments.

Since the service is deployed through a browser, a low latency connection is not required for the service to operate effectively. Given the nature of the technology in use a modern web browser will be required (eg Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).

If the data being analysed is of a sensitive nature then self hosted options are available and will require a custom price plan.
