## 1. WHAT IS MINER?

LigniteTech Miner is Cloud SaaS is the SaaS (Software as a Service) implementation of a data relationship analysis platform. It aims to provide a mechanism to link and visualize unstructurally related data. There is out of the box support for a variety of publicly available datasources and a flexible data model allows for the easy integration of any proprietary datasource.

Any data that can be captured digitally is a candidate for being used.

![Person to Person](/img/screenshots/person-to-person.png)

In this case you can see that a person has a connection to a building

Within the data model not only are the entities treated as first class citizens but so is the type of connection between them.

## 3. WHAT DATA SOURCES CAN BE USED?

Publicly available streaming sources such as Twitter, Google Plus or Facebook can be used to provide real time data. In addition, static snapshots of data can be provided using Relational databases, NoSQL databases and Flat files. Finally data can also be extracted from Big Data endpoints such as Apache Sparl, Apache Kafka or Apache Flink.

## 4. HOW MUCH DATA CAN BE ANALYSED?

The underlying technology used can be used to efficiently store and retrieve billions of data points. Several hundred thousand events per hour can be consumed, analysed and linked.
